# puppet-delegated-environment-example

This is the framework behind allowing delegated administration in a Puppet environment.

I gave a presentation at Puppetize Digital 2020 titled: **Delegated Administration in a Distributed Environment - Providing Puppet as a Service**

This is a sample of all the code needed to get a feel for how you can stand this up in your environment. I'll update this readme with a link to the video presentation once it goes live.
